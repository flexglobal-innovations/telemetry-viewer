# E4
* Low Pressure – Evaporation Pressure 
* Detect continuity across the high pressure switch in the protection device circuit.
* Low pressure in refrigerant circuit detected. 


# F4
* Wet alarm
* In cooling operation, detect the condition under which liquid refrigerant returns to the compressor, according to the temperature and pressure of each part. 
* Detect gas go into compressor or not, if yes F4 will be trigger


# JA
* High pressure sensor abnormality


# J5
* Suction pipe thermistor (R3T) abnormality 
* Temperature sensor on the suction pipe is faulty (open, short, or out of range)


# U0
* Refrigerant shortage
* Not enough refrigerant in the system (leak or undercharged) 
* Superheat
